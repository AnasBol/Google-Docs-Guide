# **About Google Docs**

Google Docs is an online word processor that lets you create and edit documents online while collaborating with other users in real time. Edits are tracked by the user making the edit, with a revision history presenting changes. An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color, and a permissions system regulates what users can do. Google Docs is accessible via an internet browser and is also available as a mobile app.
